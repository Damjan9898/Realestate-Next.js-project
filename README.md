## Real Estate Web Application

<p>This project is a <strong>personal real estate web application</strong> built using <em>Next.js</em>. It's a showcase of my skills in modern web development, integrating technologies like <em>Prisma</em> and <em>Node</em>, along with <em>Google Auth 2</em> for user registration.</p>

## Getting Started

First, you need to install node modules 

```bash
npm install
```

Then you need to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
